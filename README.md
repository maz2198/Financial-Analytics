# Financial Analytics

This repository represents several projects completed in IE HST's MS in Business Analytics and Big Data's Financial Analytics course.

## Santander Customer Transaction Prediction

This was a kaggle style project whereby the main objective was to use financial machine learning best practices and innovative techniques to move up the leaderboard of the [Santander Customer Transaction Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction). 

**Model and Results**

- Used a Light GBM and Hyper Parameter Fine Tuning.
- Used the Frequency Distribution for each Column as Feature / Data Augmentation.
- Created a separate model per Variable and then found coefficients with Logit to ensemble the predictions.

The different approachs and rationale are documented in `Finance_GroupCompetition_Santander.ipynb`.

Our final position in the Public Leader Board would be: **59** with an **AUC** score: **0.92244**

This project was completed with Guillermo Chacon, Diego Cuartas, Esteban Delgado, Aayush Kejriwal, Denis Mochalov, Mariana Narvaez and Valentina Premoli.
